# css-grid-gallery-blog
This project was started to learn and explore the functionality of CSS Grid.
The Goal of this project is to make an animated blog style image gallery that uses CSS Grid and Anim.JS.
Each page displays a different category of images. The placement of the images are currently shuffled when the page is refreshed.
